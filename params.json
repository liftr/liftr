Install the repository as a component\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ liftr install someguy/awesome-component\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Add a _lift.scss file to the `components/awesome-component` folder to tell Liftr which files it should lift. It should look like this:\r\n\r\n    ```sass\r\n    // Requires another liftr component\r\n    @import \"liftr/jquery\";\r\n\r\n    // Requires this component sass/css file\r\n    @import \"css/awesome-component\";\r\n\r\n    // Tells Liftr to include this javascript to lift this component\r\n    // Note that you don't have '.js' or '.min.js' extension. Liftr will choose appropriately.\r\n    @include load-js(\"awesome-component\", \"js/awesome-component\");\r\n\r\n    // once the everything is defined, let Liftr know it is all done\r\n    @include lifted(\"bootstrap\");\r\n    ```\r\n3. That's it! Have fun!\r\n\r\n   Now you can simply add `@import 'lift/awesome-component'` in your sass application and Liftr will do the heavy lifting for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Liftr"}
